# FAQ

## How do I play?

The best way would be to read [our players guide](players-quickstart.md).

## How do I install the bot?

See the [QuickStart for administrators](../bot-administration/admin-quickstart.md). Don't forget
to [enable](https://duckhunt.me/commands/settings/enabled) the channel !

## The bot does not work ?

Alternative titles: There are almost no commands on my channel?, The bang/reload command doesn't work, The bot stays
silent.

You didn't [enable](https://duckhunt.me/commands/settings/enabled) the channel, did you ? Maybe you should read
the [QuickStart guide for administrators](../bot-administration/admin-quickstart.md).

## Can I see the source code?

Sure you can! Head to [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord) for it!

The projet is separated in a few repositories :

- The [documentation](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/duckhunt.me-docs) you are currently reading (edits links for
  specific pages are also available on the sidebar). Written in markdown, very easy to edit for beginners and experts
  alike.
- The [bot](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4) itself, with all the [commands](https://duckhunt.me/commands), and
  the [API](../the-duckhunt-api/channels-scores-and-stats.md). Written in Python, using the discord.py library.
- The [website](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4_Web), used to format and display this documentation, but also
  to render statistics pages. Written using Django, HTML&CSS, Jinja2, and a touch of JS.
- The [docker config](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DuckHunt_Docker), tying all of this together, and allowing for
  an easy deployment of the bot.

## I want to self-host DuckHunt/I want my own copy of DuckHunt. How do I do it?

This is clearly not recommended. The official bot is the best choice in 99.9% of the cases. Note that no support will be
given for self hosted versions, and you have to update the bot in a timely fashion. However, if you still want to try
it, the best way to go ahead would be to
use [the docker configuration files](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DuckHunt_Docker).

Don't forget to claim the Selfhoster [role](../support-server/list-of-roles.md) on
the [support server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV) to be pinged for important updates.

## I found a bug! Where should I go?

Congratulations! You can go to [our support server](https://discordapp.com/invite/2BksEkV) to report it, or open
an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4/issues).

## I have a feature request/suggestion!

That's not really a question, but you can go to [GitHub](https://github.com/DuckHunt-discord/DHV4/issues) to suggest
things!

## I love you!

Me too ! ❤️

## Can I donate to support the development of the bot ?

See [this page](how-to-contribute-to-the-bot.md)! Thanks 😁.
