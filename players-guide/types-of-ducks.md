# Types of ducks

Many ducks can spawn on your channel, and it's your responsibility to recognize them and act appropriately.

## Normal ducks

![The normal duck](../.gitbook/assets/normal_duck_calgeka.png)

This duck is the "basic" duck, the one that you'll encounter the most. Killing him is easy : just type `dh!bang`, and it should die immediately \(if you can shoot, and if you don't miss your shot\).

### Golden

![If I had one dollar for every time someone complained about how rich Jeff Bezos is... I still wouldn&#x2019;t be as rich as Jeff Bezos.](../.gitbook/assets/golden_duck_calgeka.png)

This duck is worth 1.5x more experience \(15 exp\). Make sure you shoot at it first.

### Plastic

![The duck above me is jealous](../.gitbook/assets/plastic_duck_calgeka.png)

This duck will only give you half the experience of a normal duck \(5 exp\). On higher levels, it may not be worth it to shoot this duck.

### Kamikaze

![This is not an italian flag](../.gitbook/assets/kamikaze_duck_calgeka.png)

This duck is just like a normal duck, but if you leave it alone for too long, instead of just wander away, it'll KILL all the ducks alive on the channel. Don't wait until it despawns !

### Ghost

![Can you see it ? It&apos;s the ghost duck !](../.gitbook/assets/ghost_duck2_calgeka.png)

This duck does _not_ send a spawn message. You must be vigilant if you kill one : the duck you intended to kill isn't dead yet.

The best way to find them is by hugging the air, since this won't waste bullets.

### Prof \(Pr. Duck.\)

![Big brain time, with the Pr. Duck.](../.gitbook/assets/prof_duck_calgeka.png)

The professor requires you to do some math to kill it. Answer the question in the spawn message. To kill it, use the `dh!pan <number>` command. For example, if you see a prof spawning with

> Huh, quick question, what's 16 + 91 ?

You must use `dh!pan 107` to kill it. Wrong answers **WILL** waste your bullet.


### Cartographer Duck

### Baby

![Piou ? He&apos;s so cute !](../.gitbook/assets/baby_duck_calgeka.png)

Do **not** shoot at this duck, doing so would cost you a normal duck worth of experience \(10 exp\), and your bullet\(s\)!

Instead, you must [`dh!hug`](https://duckhunt.me/commands/hug) the duck to make it leave. Hugging ducks don't waste bullets.

### Mechanical

![BZAAAAK, I&apos;m the mechanical duck!](../.gitbook/assets/mechanical_duck_calgeka.png)

Technically, a mechanical duck is not a duck, and shouldn't be shot at. They can sometimes spawn from the wild, but they are most often [bought by other hunters in the shop](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/mechanical).

{% hint style="info" %}
If another duck spawns after a mechanical duck, the mechanical will leave silently. You do not have to wait for it to leave.
{% endhint %}

### Night duck

![&#x1F4A4;](../.gitbook/assets/night_duck_calgeka.png)

Only appears during the [night](https://duckhunt.me/commands/settings/night_time). Ducks that sleep are free meat : you can't miss them, but some ducks are still awake... Good night ! 

## Super ducks

![I am strong](../.gitbook/assets/super_duck_calgeka.png)

Super ducks are ducks with multiple lives. Killing them may require multiple shots, or at least [Armor Piercing](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/ap) or [explosive](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/explosive) ammo.

However, with such a big number of lives, killing them will [get you more experience](https://duckhunt.me/docs/bot-administration/edit-settings-settings-list#experience-related-settings) than usual.

### Armored

![Bullets can&apos;t penetrate my armor... Or can they ?](../.gitbook/assets/armored_duck_calgeka.png)

This duck will resist 1 dmg on almost \(90%\) every shot. To kill him, you should have at least some [AP](https://duckhunt.me/commands/shop/ap) ammo equipped.

During the [UN Treaty event](https://duckhunt.me/docs/players-guide/events#un-treaty), the armored duck does not resist shots as that would be unfair to hunters. It'll then act as a normal Super Duck, but still count towards your Armored kills !

You can see on your personal Hunter Page \(`dh!me`\) the amont of shots an armored duck resisted.

### MOAD \(Mother Of All Ducks\)

![You&apos;ll never kill my children](../.gitbook/assets/mother_of_all_ducks_calgeka.png)

Mothers are normal Super ducks that will spawn two new, random ducks once killed. The spawned ducks doesn't count towards the [ducks\_per\_day setting](https://duckhunt.me/commands/settings/ducks_per_day), and may be of any type.

If a baby spawns after you've killed a MOAD, check your [achievements](achievements-guide.md) ! You'll have unlocked `You monster`.

## Boss duck

![Array\(16\).join\(&quot;duck&quot; -1\) + &quot; Batman!&quot;](../.gitbook/assets/boss_calgeka.png)

The boss is a unique duck that will only spawn on the Official DuckHunt Support server. When killed, instead of experience, you'll get a lootbox \(box of foie gras\) delivered to your inventory. [Use](https://duckhunt.me/commands/inventory/use) it on \([almost](https://duckhunt.me/commands/settings/allow_global_items)\) any channel.
